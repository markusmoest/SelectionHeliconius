Supplementary Figure 10. Summary and selection statistics across colour pattern regions for all populations analysed in the Heliconius erato-clade. For each population genotyping coverage (calculated as proportion of retained genotypes after quality filtering in 500 bp windows), nucleotide diversity, Tajima’s D, pooled integrated haplotype homozygosity score, and SweepFinder2’s3,4 composite likelihood ratio statistics across each colour pattern region are shown (top to bottom). File names contain population and colour pattern region identifiers (Herato1001…WntA, Herato1505…cortex, Herato1801…optix).
